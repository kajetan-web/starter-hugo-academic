bio: I am a passionate scientist with a background in physics and geology,
  particularly interested in Earth's interior, wave mechanics and inverse
  problems. I believe in reproducible research and open-source software which I
  share extensively on https://github.com/kmch. My research so far has been
  focused on developing numerical methods, imaging magmatic systems, the
  lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), and the diffusion of exotic atomic
  nuclei. I am a Python enthusiast and experienced Fortran practitioner.
